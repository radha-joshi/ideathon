## Recent updates

- Added a comprehensive filtering UI on the dashboard: price range, location, condition, and sort options.
- Expanded demo listings from 6 to 20 items and standardized item fields (`price` as number, `category`, `location`, `condition`).

Use the dashboard controls to filter and sort community listings while testing the prototype locally.
